# Deep Learning Project: Time Series Forecasting & Image Classification  

This project was developed by **El Ouakhchachi Jaafar** and **Bouhdid Amal** as part of a deep learning assignment. It covers two tasks:  

1. **Task 1: Time Series Prediction with LSTMs**  
   Predicting weather patterns like temperature and rainfall using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.  

2. **Task 2: Image Classification with CNNs**  
   Categorizing images of animals into seven distinct classes: Bear, Camel, Chicken, Elephant, Horse, Lion, and Squirrel, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
